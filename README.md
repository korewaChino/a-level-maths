# A-Level Math notes

This repository is a collection of notes made in preparation for my A-Level Maths exams ([TCAS 66](https://www.mytcas.com/)), made in mdBook and "simplified" as Rust code, along with actual mathematical notation as I learn and figure out the various concepts required for Maths 1 and 2 for this year's exams.

Written in English because ICBA to switch layouts while typing, and tone/vowel marks result in longer text. Also monospace fonts don't support Thai.

## Background

I'm a Thai student who recently graduated from high school with an absolutely abysmal 1.8 GPA. I actually never did anything at all since middle school due to [mental health issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder), and that shows in my horrible transcript.

I finally recieved proper help in February of 2023 (right after graduation) and it finally gave me the drive to actually start studying again. One small issue:

**I have dysgraphia.**

I have ADHD and high-functioning autism and I struggle to write on paper, or even using a graphics tablet. However, I cope with my depression by *writing code*. And my favorite programming language happens to be the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

So I thought to myself "fuck it" and decide to make an even easier to read version of https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code as my study notes. I hope this repo may prove useful not to just me, or Thai students who happen to be able to read English, but everyone here who needed to also learn these math concepts for whatever reason.

## Personal notes

If I still don't get accepted to college after this, I might take a leap year or something. My portfolio's already fucked by my GPA anyway, so I might as well just not go to college at all and just farm certifications.
